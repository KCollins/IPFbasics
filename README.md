# IPFbasics
This repository provides basic scripts that apply the Impulse Pattern Formulation (IPF) in different programming languages. Thus, it helps to discover the IPF for the first time.

Further applications (mainly for sonification) are shown in another repository: https://github.com/Simon-Linke/IPF-Sonification-PD
