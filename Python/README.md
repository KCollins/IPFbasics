# Python Scripts

Python scripts for using the IPF as a (non-realtime) Synthesizer.

While *IPF_functions.py* provides all necessary funtions to calculate the IPF, *IPF_FreqMod.ipynb* uses the IPF as an Modulator for FM-Synthesis. Further. *IPF_PhaseShift* appllies the IPF with varing control parameter $\alpha$ to produce the sounds of a bowd string similar to:
