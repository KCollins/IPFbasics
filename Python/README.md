# Python Scripts

Python scripts for using the IPF as a (non-realtime) Synthesizer.

While *IPF_functions.py* provides all necessary functions to calculate the IPF, *IPF_FreqMod.ipynb* uses the IPF as a Modulator for FM synthesis. Further, *IPF_PhaseShift* applies the IPF with varying control parameter $\alpha$ to produce the sounds of a bowed string similar to:
