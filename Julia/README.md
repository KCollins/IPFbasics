# Julia scripts

The Julia scripts can be used to investigate the mathematical behavior of the IPF concerning stability and limits, similar to what was done by Linke et al.[[1](#1)].

*StabilitySimple.ipynb* investigates the transient behavior as well as the orbit diagram of the IPF in its most simple Form:

$$ g_+ = g- ln\left( \frac g \alpha \right)$$

*StabilityBeta.ipynb* follows with the IPF with multiple reflection points revealing the influence of initial values.
